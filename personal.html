                <p id="gaming">One of my biggest hobbies is gaming, it gives me an outlet to learn and problem solve while enjoying the artwork, design and story that others have created. I tend to play games with deep complex systems, like Path of Exile or highly competitive games, such as CS:GO.</p>
                <p class="d-none" id="reading">If I'm not working, doing school or playing a game, I'm probably reading. I enjoy a variety of genres, though a few do hold a special place in my heart. I try to find time to sit down and read for a few hours at least twice a week.</p>
                <p class="d-none" id="projects">Software development is a career plan, but it's also a hobby. I'm still learning, and there is A LOT to learn. One of the projects that I worked on outside of class is one you've already been interacting with! With the help of Gen AI to help me learn JavaScript, I made the fade-out and slide-in text you see on screen. It's still clunky and I'm sure there is a better way to do it, I could've just used bootstrap! But the thrill of learning and applying something new is rewarding, and understanding how things work is something I enjoy.</p>
